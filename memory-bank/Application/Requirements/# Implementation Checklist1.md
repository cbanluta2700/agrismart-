# Implementation Checklist

## Overview

This document outlines the remaining implementation tasks for the AgriSmart project, based on the current project status and our discussions. It serves as a tracking document to ensure all essential features and components are implemented.  This checklist prioritizes a sequential approach to avoid mixing multiple languages and technologies.  TypeScript will be used on the frontend and backend, with JavaScript for any necessary scripts.
