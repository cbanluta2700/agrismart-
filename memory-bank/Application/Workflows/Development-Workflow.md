# Development Workflow

This document outlines the standard development workflow for the AgriSmart platform. It describes the steps developers should follow when working on new features, bug fixes, or other changes.

## Workflow Steps

1.  **Task Assignment:** A task is assigned to a developer.
2.  **Branch Creation:** A new branch is created for the task.
3.  **Coding:** The developer writes the code.
4.  **Testing:** The developer tests the code.
5.  **Code Review:** The code is reviewed by other developers.
6.  **Merging:** The code is merged into the main branch.
7.  **Deployment:** The new code is deployed to the production environment.

## Branching Strategy

*   **Main Branch:** The main branch represents the production-ready code.
*   **Feature Branches:** New features are developed in separate feature branches.
*   **Bugfix Branches:** Bug fixes are developed in separate bugfix branches.
* The branch naming conventions are to be defined.

## Tools

*   **Git:** For version control.
* **Github**: For hosting the code.
*   **IDE:** For writing code.
* The other tools will be determined.
