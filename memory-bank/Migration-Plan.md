# Database Migration Plan

This document outlines the strategy for managing database migrations for the AgriSmart platform. It details the tools and processes used to update the database schema over time.

## Goals

*   **Data Integrity:** Ensure data integrity during schema changes.
*   **Minimal Downtime:** Minimize application downtime during migrations.
*   **Version Control:** Manage database schema changes under version control.
* **Collaboration**: Allow to work on the migrations in team.
* **Automation**: Automate the migrations.

## Tools

*   **Prisma Migrate:** We will use Prisma Migrate for managing database schema changes.

## Migration Process

1.  **Schema Definition:** Define schema changes in the Prisma schema file.
2.  **Migration Generation:** Generate a migration script using Prisma Migrate.
3.  **Migration Application:** Apply the migration to the development, staging, and production databases.
4.  **Testing:** Test the application after applying the migration.
5. **Rollback**: Be able to rollback the migration if needed.

## Branching Strategy

*   Migrations should be created in feature branches.
*   Migrations should be reviewed before being merged into the main branch.

## Best Practices

*   **Atomic Changes:** Keep each migration as small and focused as possible.
*   **Idempotency:** Ensure migrations can be run multiple times without causing issues.
*   **Backups:** Always back up the database before running migrations.
* **Testing**: Test the migrations on different environment before running it on production.
