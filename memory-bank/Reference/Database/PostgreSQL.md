# PostgreSQL

This document contains notes and information about PostgreSQL, the relational database used for the AgriSmart platform.

## Core Concepts

*   **Relational:** Data is stored in tables with rows and columns.
*   **ACID:** Supports ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions.
*   **SQL:** Uses SQL (Structured Query Language).
*   **Open Source:** PostgreSQL is open source.
* **Extensible**: PostgreSQL is extensible.
* **Data integrity**: PostgreSQL provides data integrity.

## Use Cases

*   Storing structured data.
*   Complex queries and joins.
*   Financial applications requiring ACID transactions.

## Considerations

*   **Scalability:** Vertical scaling is easier than horizontal scaling.
*   **Performance:** Can be slower than NoSQL for unstructured data.
* **Schema**: The schema need to be well defined.
* **Learning Curve**: PostgreSQL has a learning curve.
