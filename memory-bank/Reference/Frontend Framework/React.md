# React

This document contains notes and information about React, the JavaScript library used for building user interfaces in the AgriSmart platform.

## Core Concepts

*   **Components:** Reusable UI elements.
*   **JSX:** A syntax extension that allows HTML-like code within JavaScript.
*   **Virtual DOM:** An in-memory representation of the UI that React uses to efficiently update the actual DOM.
*   **Props:** Data passed down from parent to child components.
*   **State:** Data managed within a component.
* **Hooks**: Allow to use state and other react features.
* **React Router**: For client-side routing.

## Best Practices

*   **Component Composition:** Break down complex UI into smaller, reusable components.
*   **Props and State:** Use props for data passed down and state for data managed within a component.
*   **Immutability:** Treat state as immutable.
* **Hooks**: Use hooks to manage the state.

## Considerations

* **Learning curve**: React has a learning curve.
* **Performance**: React can be slow if it is not used correctly.
* **Complexity**: React can be complex for big projects.
