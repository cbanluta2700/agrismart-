# Microservices

This document outlines the microservices architecture considerations for the AgriSmart platform.

## Core Concepts

*   **Decoupling:** Services are independent and loosely coupled.
*   **Scalability:** Services can be scaled independently.
*   **Technology Diversity:** Different technologies can be used for different services.
* **Fault Isolation**: A failure in one service doesn't affect the other services.
* **Deployment**: Services can be deployed independently.

## Benefits

*   **Flexibility:** Teams can choose the best technology for each service.
*   **Scalability:** Services can be scaled independently.
*   **Fault Isolation:** A failure in one service doesn't affect the others.
* **Deployment**: Services can be deployed independently.

## Challenges

*   **Complexity:** Microservices architectures can be complex.
*   **Communication:** Communication between services can be complex.
*   **Data Consistency:** Maintaining data consistency can be challenging.
* **Monitoring**: Monitoring can be challenging.

## Patterns

*   **API Gateway:** A single entry point for all services.
*   **Service Discovery:** Services can find each other dynamically.
* **Message queue**: Services can communicate using a message queue.

## Best Practices

*   **Clear Boundaries:** Define clear boundaries between services.
*   **Independent Deployment:** Services should be deployable independently.
*   **Monitoring:** Monitor services and their interactions.

## Considerations

*   **Overhead:** Microservices can add overhead.
*   **Data Consistency:** Maintaining data consistency can be complex.
* **Complexity**: Microservices add complexity.
