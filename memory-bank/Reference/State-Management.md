# State Management Strategies

This document outlines the state management strategies used in the AgriSmart platform.

## Core Principles

*   **Predictability:** State changes should be predictable.
*   **Centralized:** State should be managed in a centralized way.
*   **Efficiency:** State updates should be efficient.
* **Debuggability**: The state should be easy to debug.

## Strategies

*   **Component State:** State managed within a component.

## Technologies

## Best Practices

*   **Small Stores:** Keep stores small and focused.
*   **Selectors:** Use selectors to derive data from the state.
*   **Immutability:** Treat state as immutable.
* **Hooks**: Use hooks.

## Considerations

*   **Complexity:** State management can add complexity.
*   **Performance:** Performance can be impacted by state updates.
*   **Scalability:** The chosen solution should scale well.
