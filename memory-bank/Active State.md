### Current Tasks
- [ ] Optimize conversation retrieval for large histories
- [ ] Implement caching for frequent queries
- [ ] Test the migration system with the mock data to ensure it works as expected
- [ ] Validate that the retry functionality correctly processes failed conversations
- [ ] Update user documentation to include information about the enhanced migration system
- [ ] Create admin guide for using the retry functionality

### Open Questions
1. What monitoring strategy should we use for the hybrid database architecture?
   - Answer: Created performance monitoring and connection health monitoring utilities for MongoDB and PostgreSQL
2. Should we implement connection pooling for MongoDB to optimize performance?
   - Answer: Yes, implemented connection pooling with configurable parameters to enhance performance
3. Should we implement automatic retry for certain categories of errors?
4. Would it be beneficial to add email/Slack notifications for migration completion or failures?

### Recent Decisions
1. Adopt a hybrid database approach with MongoDB for chat content and PostgreSQL for user identity
2. Maintain usage analytics in PostgreSQL for easier reporting alongside other user metrics
3. Use explicit relationship naming in the Prisma schema for the ChatUsage model
4. Created a migration script for moving existing conversations from Vercel KV to MongoDB
5. Implemented connection pooling for MongoDB with configurable parameters
6. Built a comprehensive migration control system with real-time monitoring
7. Added migration status tracking and management through shared state
8. Enhanced database migration system with retry functionality and error handling

### Next Steps
1. Run the migration script to move existing conversations from Vercel KV to MongoDB using the new migration control system
2. Monitor the migration process and ensure data integrity
3. Test the hybrid architecture with load testing
4. Monitor database performance and optimize as needed
5. Consider optimizing conversation retrieval for large histories
6. Testing the retry functionality to ensure it works as expected
7. Potentially adding additional error categorization or recovery options based on feedback

## Deployment Preparations

### Current Focus
**Deployment Preparation**
- [x] Configure MongoDB for chat storage
- [x] Set up Supabase for PostgreSQL database
- [x] Create deployment documentation
- [x] Implement database connection verification
- [x] Build deployment scripts
- [x] Create GitHub Student Pack deployment guide
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel using Student Pack benefits
- [ ] Configure custom domain

### Last Session Summary:

Successfully configured both database systems for the AgriSmart platform deployment. For MongoDB, we're using the local MongoDB server which already has the necessary databases set up. For PostgreSQL, we've configured Supabase with project URL and authentication keys. Created and tested database connection verification scripts for both database systems.

Key accomplishments:
- Configured local MongoDB connection (mongodb://localhost:27017)
- Set up Supabase PostgreSQL configuration (https://eexsqnsutjkaypilduwy.supabase.co)
- Created test scripts for both database systems
- Updated deployment documentation with detailed configuration instructions
- Successfully tested MongoDB connection
- Added Supabase client library for front-end integration

The platform is now ready for deployment to Vercel using the Student Pack benefits, with both database systems properly configured.

### Next Steps:

1. Test Supabase connection with the actual database password
2. Deploy the application to Vercel using the Student Pack benefits
3. Configure the custom domain from Namecheap
4. Set up monitoring for database usage
5. Implement automated backups for MongoDB and PostgreSQL

## March 3, 2025 (Additional Updates)

Successfully optimized the Supabase database configuration for serverless deployment on Vercel. We've implemented Supabase's Transaction Pooler and configured the required direct connection for database migrations.

Key accomplishments:
- Configured Transaction Pooler connection for optimal serverless performance
- Updated Prisma schema to support connection pooling with `directUrl` for migrations
- Updated documentation with comprehensive connection options for different deployment scenarios
- Ensured all environment variables are properly configured for production

Next steps:
- Deploy the application to Vercel using GitHub Student Pack benefits
- Configure the custom domain from Namecheap
- Monitor database performance in production
- Implement automated backups for both MongoDB and PostgreSQL databases

## March 3, 2025 (CI/CD Setup)

Successfully set up continuous integration and deployment for the AgriSmart platform using Travis CI and Vercel. This setup enables automatic deployments when changes are pushed to the main branch, ensuring a smooth development workflow.

Key accomplishments:
- Created Travis CI configuration (.travis.yml) for automated testing and deployment
- Updated Vercel deployment settings in vercel.json
- Added CI/CD related scripts to package.json
- Created a deployment script (scripts/deploy.js) for easier manual deployments
- Documented the complete CI/CD setup process in CI-CD-SETUP.md
- Created an automated setup script (scripts/setup-travis.js) to streamline the Travis CI configuration process
- Enhanced deploy.js script to handle conflicting files between the pages/ and app/ directories
- Successfully built the application by resolving file conflicts
- Pushed all changes to GitHub repository for CI/CD integration

Next steps:
- Connect the repository to Vercel through the Vercel dashboard
- Set up required environment variables in Vercel
- Deploy the application through Vercel's GitHub integration

## Technical Notes
- MongoDB provides better scalability for the append-heavy nature of chat data
- PostgreSQL maintains a single source of truth for user identity
- Proper indexing is crucial for both databases to ensure performance
- Environment variables need to be configured for both databases
- Migration process uses shared state pattern across API routes to maintain consistency
- Admin dashboard provides visual indicators of migration progress and database health
