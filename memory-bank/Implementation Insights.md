### Authentication with JWT and NextAuth

*   **Problem:** Implementing a secure, scalable, and flexible authentication system that supports email/password login, social login, password reset, and email verification.
*   **Solution:**
    *   Utilize JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless authentication.
    *   Use NextAuth.js to simplify social login (Google, Facebook, GitHub) and email/password management.
    *   Implement secure token-based password reset flow.
    *   Create email verification workflow using temporary tokens.
    *   Hash passwords with bcrypt for security.
    *   Use Zod for data validation.
    *   Implement nodemailer for sending transactional emails (verification, password reset).
*   **Insight**: 
    *   The use of JWTs allows us to have a stateless authentication system that scales well.
    *   NextAuth.js provides a unified API for multiple authentication providers, simplifying social login integration.
    *   Token-based password reset and email verification provide a secure way to validate user actions.
    *   Using environment variables for all sensitive information (OAuth client IDs, SMTP settings) keeps the application secure.
*   **Considerations:**
    *   JWTs have a short expiration time and need to be refreshed.
    *   NextAuth.js only supports a limited number of providers.
    *   We need to handle the validation on both client and server sides.
    *   Email deliverability needs to be monitored in production.
    *   Token security (expiration, verification) is critical for password reset functionality.
    *   Error messages must be user-friendly but not reveal sensitive information.

### Real-Time Chat with Socket.IO and WebSockets

*   **Problem**: How to implement a real time chat.
*   **Solution**:
    *   Use Socket.IO and Websockets to create a real time connection.
    *   Use Redis to store the messages.
*   **Insight**: Socket.IO and Websockets allow a real-time bidirectional communication. Redis is fast and allow us to store and retrieve the messages quickly.
*   **Considerations**:
    *   We need to manage the sockets.
    *   We need to handle the different events.
    *   We need to manage the Redis instance.

### Payment Gateway with Stripe

*   **Problem**: How to implement a payment system.
*   **Solution**:
    *   Integrate Stripe as our payment gateway.
*   **Insight**: Stripe is easy to use, secure and popular.
*   **Considerations**:
    *   We need to create an account on stripe.
    *   We need to handle the webhooks.

    *   [[Application/Memory Bank/Architecture Decisions]]

### Database Schema Design

*   **Problem**: How to define the database schema.
*   **Solution**:
    *   Use PostgreSQL as our database.
    *   Use Prisma as ORM.
*   **Insight**: PostgreSQL is a robust and scalable database. Prisma makes it easier to create and update the schema.
*   **Considerations**:
    *   We are limited to relational databases.
    *   We are limited to the database supported by prisma.
*   **Related**:

    *   [[Application/Memory Bank/Architecture Decisions]]

### Frontend Technologies

*   **Problem**: How to define the frontend technologies.
*   **Solution**:
    *   Use Next.js as framework.
    *   Use RadixUI for UI.
    *   Use TailwindCSS for styling.
    *   Use Zustand for state management.
    *   Use TanStack Query for data fetching.
*   **Insight**: Next.js allow us to create performant app. RadixUI is easy to use and accessible. TailwindCSS is easy to use. Zustand is easy to use and efficient. TanStack Query is easy to use and powerful.
*   **Considerations**:
    *   We are limited to the features provided by these technologies.

### Resources Section

*   **Problem**: How to implement a resources section.
*   **Solution**:
    *   Integrate Vercel SDK for optimized content delivery through edge caching.
    *   Implement content models for articles, guides, videos, and glossary terms.
    *   Optimize images through Vercel SDK to reduce bandwidth and improve loading times.
    *   Create a content versioning system to enable draft/published workflows.
    *   Deploy content globally using edge deployment strategy for faster access.

    *   Create custom React hooks (useArticles, useGuides, etc.) for efficient data fetching with SWR.
    *   Organize content using categories system for better navigation and discovery.
    *   Support MDX for interactive content within articles and guides.
    *   Implement related content suggestions to improve user engagement and discovery.
*   **Insight**: Vercel SDK provides optimized content delivery through edge caching. Content models enable organized content management. Image optimization reduces bandwidth and improves loading times. Content versioning system enables draft/published workflows. Edge deployment strategy distributes content globally for faster access. Custom React hooks provide efficient data fetching with SWR. Content categories system enables organized navigation and discovery. MDX support allows for interactive content within articles and guides. Related content suggestions improve user engagement and discovery.
*   **Considerations**:
    *   We need to manage the content.
    *   We need to handle the different content types.

### Resources Section with Vercel SDK Integration

*   **Problem**: How to optimize resource content delivery for performance and scalability.
*   **Solution**:
    *   Integrate Vercel SDK for content optimization and delivery
    *   Create optimization utilities for resource images (`lib/resource-optimizations.ts`)
    *   Implement automatic SDK initialization on server startup (`server.js`)
    *   Add on-demand optimization API endpoint for admin use (`pages/api/admin/initialize-optimizations.ts`)
    *   Enhance ResourceCard component to use optimized images with responsive sizing
    *   Update search functionality to leverage edge caching
*   **Insight**: 
    *   Vercel SDK provides significant performance improvements through edge caching and image optimization
    *   Automatic initialization ensures optimizations are applied consistently in production
    *   The ResourceCard component shows better Core Web Vitals scores with optimized images
    *   The implementation significantly reduces bandwidth usage and improves page load times
    *   Edge caching for search results reduces database load and improves response times
*   **Considerations**:
    *   Environment variables must be correctly configured (VERCEL_API_TOKEN, VERCEL_TEAM_ID)
    *   Initialization should only occur in production to avoid rate limiting during development
    *   Admin API endpoint requires proper authentication to prevent unauthorized access
    *   Image optimization should consider different contexts (thumbnails, featured images, avatars)
    *   Cache durations should be appropriate for content update frequency
