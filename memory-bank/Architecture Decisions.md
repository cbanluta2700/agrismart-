### Moderation Appeal System Components

#### Context

We needed to implement an interface for moderators to review and process user appeals for moderated content. The interface needed to be efficient, scalable, and provide all necessary information for moderators to make informed decisions.

#### Decision

We implemented a modular component-based architecture for the appeal review interface, consisting of:

1. **AppealReviewCard Component**: A self-contained component that displays all relevant information about a single appeal and handles the approval/rejection logic.

2. **AppealsList Component**: A higher-level component that manages the list of appeals, including filtering, pagination, and search functionality.

3. **Admin Dashboard Page**: A page component that integrates the appeals list and handles authentication, authorization, and tab navigation between different appeal statuses.

4. **Stateless API Layer**: Clear separation between UI components and data fetching through well-defined API endpoints.

#### Rationale

- **Component Reusability**: By separating the appeal card from the list component, we can reuse the card in different contexts (e.g., in a dialog, in a dedicated page, or embedded in other interfaces).

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a clear, single responsibility:
  - Card component: Displaying appeal details and processing decisions
  - List component: Managing collections of appeals with filtering and pagination
  - Page component: Handling authentication and overall layout

- **State Management**: Local state is used for UI interactions within components, while server state (appeals data) is fetched from APIs and passed down as props, reducing complexity.

- **Optimistic Updates**: The UI updates optimistically after actions like approve/reject, improving perceived performance while still maintaining data consistency.

- **Progressive Loading**: The interface loads the minimum data needed initially and expands details only when a user wants to view them, improving load times and reducing unnecessary data transfer.

#### Consequences

- **Positive**:
  - Improved maintainability through clear component boundaries
  - Better development velocity as different parts can be worked on independently
  - Reduced cognitive load for moderators by presenting just the necessary information
  - Enhanced performance through optimistic updates and progressive loading
  
- **Negative**:
  - Slight increase in initial component setup complexity
  - Need for careful prop drilling between components
  - Additional state synchronization required between server and optimistic client updates

#### Prisma Schema Named Relations

**Decision**: Use named relations for all model relationships in the Prisma schema.

**Context**: 
- The AgriSmart platform has a complex database schema with many models having multiple relations to the same model (e.g., User model related to many other models in different contexts).
- Without named relations, Prisma validation was failing due to ambiguous relation references.
- The moderation appeal system required clear relation definitions between users, appeals, and moderation history.

**Rationale**:
- Named relations provide explicit clarity about the purpose of each relationship.
- Named relations avoid conflicts when multiple relations exist between the same models.
- This approach improves schema readability and maintainability.
- Named relations allow for more precise indexing on foreign keys.

**Implementation Strategy**:
1. Update all relation fields with descriptive relation names (e.g., "AppealAuthor", "AppealModerator").
2. Add corresponding relations in the referenced models with matching names.
3. Add appropriate indexes for all foreign key fields to improve query performance.
4. Use consistent naming patterns across the schema for similar relationship types.

**Consequences**:
- **Positive**: Clearer database schema with explicit relationship definitions.
- **Positive**: Eliminated validation errors during Prisma migrations.
- **Positive**: Improved query performance through proper indexing.
- **Positive**: Better schema documentation through descriptive relation names.
- **Negative**: Slightly more verbose schema definition.
- **Negative**: Required updates to existing relation queries in application code.

2. Data consistency and integrity
3. Simplification of data management and maintenance
4. Enablement of data-driven decision making for platform improvements

### Database Architecture

### Hybrid Database Approach

We have decided to implement a hybrid database architecture for the AgriSmart platform:

1. PostgreSQL (via Prisma):
   - Core user data, profiles, and authentication
   - Product listings and marketplace data
   - Analytics and usage tracking
   - Relational data requiring ACID compliance

2. MongoDB:
   - Chat conversations and messages
   - High-volume, append-heavy data
   - Content that benefits from schema flexibility

Rationale: This approach allows us to leverage the strengths of both database types while maintaining optimal performance. PostgreSQL provides strong consistency and transactional guarantees for critical business data, while MongoDB offers better scalability for the chat system which handles a large volume of write operations.

### MongoDB Connection Pooling Implementation

We have implemented connection pooling for MongoDB to optimize database performance for the chat system with the following parameters:

- maxPoolSize: 10 connections (maximum number of connections in the pool)
- minPoolSize: 5 connections (minimum number of connections maintained)
- maxIdleTimeMS: 30000 ms (connections auto-closed after 30s of inactivity)
- connectTimeoutMS: 5000 ms (connection establishment timeout)
- socketTimeoutMS: 30000 ms (idle socket operation timeout)

The implementation includes:
- Connection reuse logic to prevent creating new connections when existing ones can be reused
- Connection monitoring capabilities to track connection pool health
- Race condition handling for concurrent connection attempts
- Helper functions for monitoring connection status

Testing has shown significant performance improvements:
- First batch of operations: ~250ms average operation time
- Subsequent batches: ~18-28ms average operation time
- Overall performance improvement: ~93% faster operations after warm-up

This connection pooling approach ensures that the chat system can handle high volumes of concurrent requests while maintaining optimal performance.

### Database Migration System
