   - Implement moderator performance metrics

### Phase 4: Bulk Moderation (Week 5)

1. **Selection Tools**
   - Extend bulk moderation utilities for comment handling
   - Create selection tools for similar comments
   - Implement pattern-based selection
   - Add intelligent grouping of related comments

2. **Batch Actions**
   - Add batch approval/rejection functionality
   - Implement category tagging for multiple comments
   - Create undo functionality for bulk actions
   - Add performance optimizations for large operations

### Phase 5: Quality Enhancement (Week 6)

1. **Comment Improvement**
   - Implement readability suggestions
   - Create constructive feedback generation
   - Add automated improvement prompts
   - Implement engagement optimization suggestions

2. **Content Enrichment**
   - Create recommendation system for adding references
   - Implement suggestion UI for comment authors
   - Add ML-based enhancement prioritization

## Integration with Existing Systems

1. **AI Moderation System**
   - Leverage existing AI moderation system for initial content screening
   - Extend with comment-specific analysis models
   - Use existing caching and optimization patterns

2. **Fluid Compute Optimization**
   - Apply established patterns for background processing
   - Implement efficient caching strategies for comment analysis results
   - Configure appropriate warmup mechanisms for comment-related functions

3. **Analytics Dashboard**
   - Extend moderation analytics to include comment-specific metrics
   - Add visualization components for comment moderation trends
   - Create performance tracking for moderation actions

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Testing**
   - Create comprehensive tests for comment analysis functions
   - Test report submission and processing logic
   - Validate moderation action handlers

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test end-to-end comment submission, analysis, and moderation workflow
   - Verify notification system integration
   - Test bulk operations with large datasets

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Benchmark comment analysis under load
   - Test bulk moderation operations with varying dataset sizes
   - Validate caching effectiveness

## Rollout Plan

1. **Internal Testing** (Week 7)
   - Deploy to staging environment
   - Conduct thorough testing with internal team
   - Gather feedback and implement improvements

2. **Limited Beta** (Week 8)
   - Release to select users/moderators
   - Monitor performance and gather feedback
   - Make necessary adjustments
