# Database Comparison

This document compares different database options considered for the AgriSmart platform, with a focus on PostgreSQL and MongoDB.

## Databases Evaluated

*   **PostgreSQL:** A robust, open-source relational database management system (RDBMS).
*   **MongoDB:** A popular NoSQL document database.

## Comparison Criteria

*   **Data Model:** How data is structured and stored.
*   **Scalability:** How well the database handles increasing amounts of data and traffic.
*   **Performance:** How quickly the database can read and write data.
*   **Transactions:** How the database handles complex transactions and ensures data consistency.
*   **Query Language:** The language used to query the database.
*   **Community & Support:** The size and activity of the community, as well as the availability of commercial support.
*   **Ecosystem:** How many tools are available to use with this database.
* **Security**: What security features are provided by the database.

## PostgreSQL

*   **Data Model:** Relational (tables, rows, columns).
*   **Scalability:** Excellent scalability with proper design and tools.
*   **Performance:** High performance for structured data and complex queries.
*   **Transactions:** Full ACID compliance.
*   **Query Language:** SQL.
*   **Community & Support:** Large and active community, strong commercial support.
* **Ecosystem**: Has a large number of tools.
* **Security**: Provide security features.

## MongoDB

*   **Data Model:** Document-oriented (JSON-like documents).
*   **Scalability:** Highly scalable, especially for unstructured data.
*   **Performance:** Excellent for document-based operations, but joins and transactions can be less efficient.
*   **Transactions:** Supports multi-document transactions, but not as robust as relational databases.
*   **Query Language:** MongoDB Query Language (MQL).
*   **Community & Support:** Large and active community, strong commercial support.
* **Ecosystem**: Has a large number of tools.
* **Security**: Provide security features.

## Decision

*   **PostgreSQL:** Chosen for its relational data model, strong transaction support, and proven scalability for structured data.
